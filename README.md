# Bearclave: Simplifying Cloud-Based TEE Development
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a fascinating fusion of specialized  
hardware and software designed to enhance the confidentiality and integrity of  
sensitive code and data. Curious developers often want to explore TEE technology  
but soon find themselves overwhelmed by steep learning curves and complicated  
requirements. The challenges include:

- Limited documentation that can be dense, scattered, or difficult to understand.
- The need for specialized hardware that is either costly or requires complex setup.
- A deep understanding of how TEEs function and interact with cloud platforms.

Bearclave is here to bridge that knowledge gap! This repository is tailored for  
developers—whether individuals or small teams—who want to take their first steps  
into the world of cloud-based TEE application development. Bearclave provides all  
the necessary resources to go from zero to a working example, while keeping the  
process approachable and affordable.

### What Bearclave Offers
This repository offers a holistic, step-by-step guide to developing TEE  
applications, including:

- **Introduction to TEEs**: A high-level overview of TEEs and popular  
  platforms such as AWS Nitro, AMD SEV-SNP, and Intel TDX.
- **Cloud Integration Guides**: Detailed instructions for configuring the cloud  
  resources needed to build and deploy TEE applications on AWS and GCP.
- **Practical Code Examples**: Demonstrations of how to compile, deploy, and
  interact with real-world applications on different TEE platforms.
- **Platform-Agnostic Code**: Bearclave provides a framework for developing
  applications across various TEE platforms. By abstracting away
  platform-specific details, you can more easily write portable applications 
  without worrying about the idiosyncrasies of the underlying TEE implementation.

Additionally, Bearclave includes a **"No TEE" development mode**, allowing you to  
develop and test your application without a TEE instance. This reduces costs  
significantly, making the barrier to entry even lower.

### A Note on Costs
Building and deploying TEE applications typically requires specialized hardware,  
which isn't free. Unless you own and manage the hardware yourself, you'll need to  
rent resources through cloud providers like AWS or GCP. Fortunately, these  
providers offer affordable, TEE-enabled instances starting at $0.17 to $0.40 per  
hour. Paired with Bearclave's "No TEE" mode, you can develop and test your  
applications for just a few dollars a month if you carefully manage your instances.

### Important Reminder

Bearclave is designed as an educational tool. While the repository provides  
practical examples and working code, it should not be considered production-ready.  
We encourage you to use it as a learning resource and adapt it for your unique  
production needs.

We hope Bearclave inspires you to explore the exciting world of Trusted Execution  
Environments and eases your journey into TEE-enabled cloud applications!

# Getting Started
Bearclave has only been tested on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. Modifications to the
example Makefiles and Dockerfiles may be required if you wish to build and
deploy from other systems.

## TEE Overview
Please refer to [this](docs/TEE.md) document for a high-level overview of TEEs
and popular implementations such as AWS Nitro, AMD SEV-SNP, and Intel TDX.

---

## Install Dependencies
Please ensure that all tools are properly installed and added to your system's
`PATH` for seamless use.

- **[Golang (version 1.24.3 or higher):](https://go.dev/dl/)** this project
  is written in Go and is required for building and running the examples.

- **[Docker Engine:](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)** cloud-based TEE
  platforms require you to provide your application packaged as an OCI-compliant
  image. While you could use any OCI-compliant tool, the build and deploy
  commands in the examples assume you have `docker`.

- **[Process Compose:](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose)** a simple
  tool modeled after `docker-compose` for initializing non-containerized
  applications. This is a convenience for running the "No TEE" versions of the
  example applications, but is not strictly necessary for running on cloud-based
  TEEs.

These are the minimum set of tools required to build and run the Bearclave
examples locally in "No TEE" mode. If you wish to run on real TEE platforms,
follow the steps detailed in [Configure Cloud Resources](#configure-cloud-resources).

---

## Configure Cloud Resources
If you wish to use Nitro Enclaves, refer to the [AWS setup guide](docs/AWS.md).
If you wish to use AMD SEV-SNP or Intel TDX, refer to the 
[GCP setup guide](docs/GCP.md).

## Build and Deploy Examples
The `examples/` directory contains code demonstrating the basics of TEE
application development and deployment on the AWS Nitro Enclaves, GCP AMD-SEV,
and GCP Intel TDX platforms.

- [**Hello World:**](examples/hello-world/README.md) demonstrates how to deploy
an application to a TEE and communicate with it via (virtual) sockets.
- [**Hello HTTP:**](examples/hello-http/README.md) demonstrates how to deploy an 
HTTP server to a TEE.
- [**Hello HTTP Multi:**](examples/hello-http-multi/README.md) demonstrates how
to deploy multiple HTTP servers to the same TEE.
